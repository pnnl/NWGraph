===========================================================
Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (BGL Book Chapter 6)
===========================================================

Overview
--------

This example demonstrates Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning
tree of an undirected weighted graph. Unlike Kruskal's algorithm which
works with edges, Prim's algorithm grows the MST from a starting vertex.
Both algorithms produce the same MST (or one of equal weight if there
are ties), but Prim's is often more efficient for dense graphs.

Algorithm Description
--------------------

See the source code for algorithm details.

NWGraph Implementation
---------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/bgl-book/ch6_prim.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-37

The main function demonstrates the algorithm:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/bgl-book/ch6_prim.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :lines: 81-147

Running the Example
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build/examples/bgl-book
   ./ch6_prim

Sample Output
------------
