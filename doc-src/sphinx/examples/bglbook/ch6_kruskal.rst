==============================================================
Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (BGL Book Chapter 6)
==============================================================

Overview
--------

This example demonstrates Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning
tree of an undirected weighted graph. The algorithm works by sorting edges
by weight and adding them to the tree if they don't create a cycle.
Application: Network design - finding the minimum cost way to connect all
nodes in a network (e.g., laying cable between cities).

Algorithm Description
--------------------

See the source code for algorithm details.

NWGraph Implementation
---------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/bgl-book/ch6_kruskal.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-36

The main function demonstrates the algorithm:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/bgl-book/ch6_kruskal.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :lines: 32-134
   :caption: Main function


Running the Example
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build/examples/bgl-book
   ./ch6_kruskal

Sample Output
