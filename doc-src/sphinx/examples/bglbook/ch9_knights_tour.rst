=====================================================
Implicit Graphs: A Knight's Tour (BGL Book Chapter 9)
=====================================================

Overview
--------

This example demonstrates solving the knight's tour problem using an
implicit graph representation. The knight's tour is finding a path for
a chess knight to visit every square on an n×n chessboard exactly once.
Key concepts demonstrated:
- Implicit graph representation (no explicit adjacency list)
- Backtracking search algorithm
- Warnsdorff's heuristic for faster solution
The knight's tour is an example of a Hamiltonian path problem, which is
NP-complete. Warnsdorff's heuristic makes it tractable for small boards.

Algorithm Description
--------------------

See the source code for algorithm details.
