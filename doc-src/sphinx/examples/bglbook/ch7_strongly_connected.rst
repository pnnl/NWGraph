=======================================================================
Strongly Connected Components and Web Page Links (BGL Book Chapter 7.3)
=======================================================================

Overview
--------

This example demonstrates Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected
components (SCCs) in a directed graph. A strongly connected component is a
maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
Application: Web page analysis - groups of pages that link to each other form
strongly connected components. A study of 200 million web pages found that
56 million pages formed one large SCC.
Tarjan's algorithm runs in O(V + E) time using a single DFS traversal.

Algorithm Description
--------------------

See the source code for algorithm details.

NWGraph Implementation
