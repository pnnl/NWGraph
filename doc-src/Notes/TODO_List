TODO List

"pre_release" branch

- change "fill" to "copy"
  - make edge list const (don't sort original edge list)
  - make an overload with move that steals the input vectors
  - fix fill undirected to work in place like fill directed (no Tmp)

- add adjacency constructor(s) for pair of vector / vector of pairs, with and without N argument (#vertices)

- parallelize "iota" in proxysort (make a util/par_iota.hpp -- we use this alot)

- what is the reference type for outer_iterator in compressed?

=> AL

- define definitively adjacency vs incidence and provide in adjacency.hpp and incidence.hpp (and appropriate concepts and adapters) 
=> AL

- Cleanup of documentation (need to write some more intro material)

- Create more tests that give us more coverage

- Make sure all tests and benchmarks and apbs compile and run

- Make sure cmake and so forth all work
  - Docker image
  => AL 

- migrate bench to json output
  - remove std::filesystem
  => JF?

- move bipartite graph functionality from NWhy to NWgr
- propagate new interface in NWgr to NWhy
  => XL

- build.hpp:  rename "fill" to "copy"  (and add "move")
  => AL

- Q: how should we handle all the different variants of some algorithms?
  A: "experimental" subdirectory

- QQ:  What are the "best" versions for each algorithm (from the IISWC paper)?
  => XL to find out for all the algorithms and note 

- Q: is the organization of files what we want?

- Q: what is NW graph?
  A: Library of graph concepts, algorithms, and data structures compatible with C++ standard library and modern C++ programming idioms.

  - one approach -- files that users include are at top level
    adjacency, build, edge_list

    - documentation should be navigable

- Where does is_open go?  Need to use consistently.  (If we need it.)

- Q: non-default move constructors needed for adjacency ?
  => XL

- Change enums to class enums


=====
Small

  get rid of N_ ?


=====

- struct of arrays view of other containers to build graph
  - struct of arrays view of containers as edge list
  - struct of arrays view of containers as compressed 
  - reorder vs indirect


- Graph containers should have read/write flags (static)

- bipartite_graph_base should allow two different vertex_id types

- batch insert constructor / function -- parallel

- hypersparse support
